# a walk to clear your mind

This piece is meant to be experienced on a mobile device
while the user goes for a walk.

the screen fills with dancing circles and 
discordant arppeggios are played, 
evoking the anxiety of a cluttered mind. 
as the user walks and time passes, 
the circles become less saturated and start to disappear, 
and the music slows down and becomes more "pleasant". 
once time is up, the interface fades away.

tech: 
i ended up experimenting with a lot of new libraries 
and apis for this piece. 
i used tone.js for creating the synthesized sounds, sequencing, and mixing. 
i used tonal to select notes that fit into scales. 
i used turf.js to calculate the user's movement speed.
